	"$selfillum"			"0"				// (Boolean) Determines if your mesh glows in the dark. By default, will use your basetextures alpha channel for per texel lighting. Cannot be used with $translucent.
	"$translucent"			"0"				// (Boolean) Determines if your mesh is transparent. By default uses your base textures alpha channel for per texel transparency. Cannot be used with $selfillum.
	"$halflambert"			"1"				// (Boolean) Wraps lighting further around mesh to prevent definition loss. Enabled automatically if using phong shading.

	"$detailscale" 			"8"				// (Float) Controls scale of the detail texture. Higher number means larger tiles.
